# GEMINI.md - Docket Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a Student Docket Management System. It's a web application designed to allow students to view and download their exam dockets, and for university staff (lecturers, administrators) to verify these dockets using QR codes. The system is built with a Python Flask backend and a plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend.

**Key Features:**

*   **Student Portal:** Students can log in, view their eligibility for dockets, and generate dockets for different exams (CA1, CA2, Final Exam).
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators have a separate interface to manage student data, block/unblock students, and set the currently active exam.
*   **QR Code Verification:** Each docket includes a QR code. A verification page allows staff to scan the QR code to confirm the docket's validity. This is designed to work offline as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
*   **Authentication:** The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for securing the API endpoints.

**Technologies:**

*   **Backend:** Python, Flask, Gunicorn
*   **Database:** MySQL
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Key Python Libraries:** Flask-CORS, PyJWT, passlib, qrcode, reportlab, mysql-connector-python

## Building and Running

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r Docket-system-backend/requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Make sure you have a MySQL server running.
    *   Create a database (e.g., `docket_system`).
    *   Import the schema from `docket_system2 .1.sql`.
    *   Configure the database connection by creating a `.env` file in the `Docket-system-backend` directory with the following variables:
        ```
        DB_HOST=localhost
        DB_USER=your_db_user
        DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
        DB_NAME=docket_system
        JWT_SECRET=a_very_secret_key
        ```

3.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    python Docket-system-backend/app.py
    ```
    The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 2. Frontend

The frontend is served directly by the Flask backend. No separate build step is required. You can access the application by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

### 3. Testing with Ngrok

The `NGROK_SETUP_AND_TESTING.txt` file provides instructions on how to use `ngrok` to expose your local server to the internet for testing the QR code scanning functionality on mobile devices.

## Development Conventions

*   **Modular Structure:** The Flask backend is organized into Blueprints for different parts of the application (e.g., `dockets`, `admin_controls`, `verification`).
*   **Authentication:** API routes are protected using a `@jwt_required` decorator. The JWT can be passed as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header or as a cookie.
*   **Configuration:** Application and database settings are managed through environment variables.
*   **Frontend Logic:** The frontend uses `localStorage` to store the JWT and basic user information.
*   **Static Files:** The Flask application is configured to serve the frontend's static files (HTML, CSS, JS) from the `Docket-system-frontend/frontend` directory.

## Changelog
