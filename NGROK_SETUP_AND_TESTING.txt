NGROK Setup and Application Testing Guide

This document outlines how to set up ngrok to expose your local development server to the internet and how to test the docket scanning feature.

*** IMPORTANT: Ensure your Flask backend server is running before starting ngrok. ***

1.  **Download and Install ngrok:**
    If you don't have ngrok installed, download it from the official website: https://ngrok.com/download
    Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
    You may also need to set up your authtoken, which you can find on your ngrok dashboard after signing up.

2.  **Start ngrok:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt.
    Run the following command to expose your Flask backend server (which typically runs on port 5000):
    ```bash
    ngrok http 5000
    ```
    Ngrok will display a public URL (e.g., `https://xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx.ngrok-free.app`). This is your public access point.

3.  **Access the Application:**
    Open a web browser and navigate to the ngrok public URL provided in your terminal.
    You should be able to access the frontend of your application through this URL.

4.  **Test the Docket Scanning Feature:**
    a.  **Log in as an Admin:** Navigate to the admin login page (e.g., `https://your-ngrok-url/admin-login.html`) and log in.
    b.  **Generate a New Docket:** Go to the docket generation section of the admin dashboard. Generate a new docket for a student and an exam type. This will create a PDF with a QR code.
    c.  **Open the Scanner:** Navigate to the docket verification page (e.g., `https://your-ngrok-url/verify-docket.html`).
    d.  **Scan the QR Code:** Point your camera at the QR code on the newly generated docket.

5.  **Expected Behavior:**
    *   The scanner should successfully read the QR code.
    *   The application should display "DOCKET VALID" along with the student's details (Name, Student Number, Programme, Exam Type).
    *   If you try to scan the *same* valid docket again, it should now show "DOCKET INVALID - Docket is invalid, has already been used, or does not exist."
    *   If you scan a completely invalid QR code, it should also show "DOCKET INVALID - Docket is invalid, has already been used, or does not exist."
